Installation
============

Install dependencies
--------------------

There is more than one way to do this:


In Debian/Ubuntu with root access
_________________________________

  $ sudo apt-get install python-sqlalchemy python-pyparsing python-feedparser python-sqlite


With easy_install
_________________

If you have root access, then you can do:

$ sudo easy_install feedparser pyparsing pysqlite SQLAlchemy

If you haven't, make sure you set a valid --install-dir which is also in your
PYTHONPATH:

$ easy_install --install-dir=$HOME/lib/python feedparser pyparsing pysqlite SQLAlchemy


Manual installation
___________________

Visit each website and follow their instructions to install the software:

- http://www.sqlalchemy.org/
- http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/
- http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/
- http://www.feedparser.org/


Leolo installation
------------------

First, download the source code from the official page: http://github.com/Menda/Leolo

$ sudo python setup.py install

or

$ python setup.py install --home=$HOME


Uninstalling Leolo
------------------

Unfortunatelly, there isn't a ''python setup.py uninstall'', you have to do
it manually.

Go to the place where you installed the application - e.g. $HOME/lib/python -
and delete the .egg file(s) and the line which points at it in
''easy-install.pth''.
